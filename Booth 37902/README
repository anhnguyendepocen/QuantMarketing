37902-50: Foundations of Advanced Quantitative Marketing

Python code to implement each of the models discussed in the class

PS1:
1) Estimate the parameters of the simple logit model 
2) Compute standard errors for your estimates

PS2:

1) Nested logit model
   (i) brands 1 and 4 in one next and 3 and 2 in another; 
   (ii) 1 and 2 in one nest and 3 and 4 in another. 
2) Compute the cross-elasticity matrix

PS3:
1) Compute the nested logit elasticities (if you haven’t already done so)

2) Try out the IIA tests

3) Work on the observable heterogeneity model – both a priori and with interactions 

4) Latent-segment / latent-class / discrete heterogeneity model with 2 segments


PS4:

1) Complete the discrete segment case 

2) Try 2, 3, 4, and 5 segments; BIC criterion

3) Compute the elasticities and show how IIA is now violated at the aggregate

4) Compute the posterior assignment and compare the size of the a priori segment sizes to the numbers allocated to the segments.

5) Try the concomitant variable model.

PS5 - Random Coefficients Model
1) Estimate the continuous RC model. Try different numbers of draws as well as antithetic draws. 

2) Try computing the elasticities and posterior parameter estimates for each household.

3) K means cluster based on these estimates and compare with assignments from the discrete heterogeneity case.

PS5 - Factor Attributes Model
With the OJ data try to estimate the factor map under the continuous case.

PS6 - BLP Model for Aggregate Data

PS7: Control function approach (Petrin & Train, JMR) to account fot endogeneity with aggregate data

PS8:
With PhysicDiff data:
1) Bayesian learning model (physician detailing datasets and ED category)

2) Allow for some unobserved heterogeneity across physicians with RC model 

With ED Category data:
3) Account for risk aversion

4) Accommodate forgetting in the model
