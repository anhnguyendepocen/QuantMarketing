# Quantitative Marketing

I am passionate about developing computational and statistical models to help Supply better meets Demand (a.k.a "Equilibrium"!) in the real-word markets, especially e-commerence, retails, restaurants, marriage, job, education, etc.


My current research interests are understanding and predicting different market segments' reactions towards marketing activities, such as pricing, advertising, and product recommendation. The purpose is to enable sellers provide personalized services to different customers.

This field is interdisciplinary and uses tools from econometrics, microeconomics, statistics, machine learning, data mining, operations research, NLP, behavior science, etc.

The folder "Booth 37902" contains my Python code to assignments at Foundations of Advanced Quantitative Marketing course. I am the only master student in this doctoral course.
