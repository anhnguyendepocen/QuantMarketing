# Quantitative Marketing

I am passionate about developing computational and statistical models to analyze the markets, especially e-commerence, retails, restaurants, marriage, job, education, etc.


My current interests are analyzing and predicting different market segments' reactions towards marketing activities, such as pricing, advertising, and product recommendation. The purpose is to enable companies better understand customers.

This field is interdisciplinary and uses tools from econometrics, microeconomics, statistics, machine learning, data mining, operations research, NLP, behavior science, etc.

The folder "Booth 37902" contains my Python code to assignments at Foundations of Advanced Quantitative Marketing course in Winter 2019. I am the only master student in this doctoral course.
