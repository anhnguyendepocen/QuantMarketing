# Quantitative Marketing

I am passionate about developing computational and statistical models to analyze and understand the marketing activities.

This field is interdisciplinary and uses tools from econometrics, microeconomics, statistics, machine learning, data mining, operations research, NLP, behavior science, etc.

The folder "Booth 37902" contains my Python code to assignments at Foundations of Advanced Quantitative Marketing course in Winter 2019. I am the only master student in this doctoral course.
