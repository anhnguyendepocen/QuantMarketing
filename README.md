# Quantitative Marketing

My research interests are understanding and predicting customers' reactions towards marketing activities, such as pricing, advertising, and product recommendation. This field is interdisciplinary and uses tools from econometrics, microeconomics, statistics, machine learning, data mining, operations research, behavior science, etc.
